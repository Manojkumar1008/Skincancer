[Project Name]
Skin Cancer Classification using Three-Way Decision-Based Bayesian Deep Learning

[Description]
This repository contains the implementation of an advanced skin cancer classification system using a novel approach that combines Bayesian deep learning and a three-way decision framework. The primary goal of the project is to develop a robust and accurate model for early skin cancer diagnosis, helping improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
